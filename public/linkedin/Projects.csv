Professional Portal Pilot Workflow Wigo4It,"For a professional portal pilot we designed and put together a software architecture for Human Workflow which is tightly coupled to existing automated processes in BizTalk.   The human workflow (Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation) allows the end user to support the automated process by further classifying the next steps to be taken when the Business Rule Engine (Microsoft BRE on BizTalk) fires rules that could not be further automated.  The user classification(s) that gets harvested during workflow result in higher quality data sets before it's being sent to various back-office applications (silo's). These include, but are not limited to: improved reporting, logging and business intelligence.  This is the first Pilot for Wigo4it that is launched in the Professional Portal Program.",,Sep 2015,
UWV Nation Wide Single Sign-On Portal for Dutch Employers and Employees,"Single Sign-On Portal UWV Employers and Employees  This is a major Internet Portal application developed in C# ASP.NET and Java bridging to RSA ClearTrust™ SDK’s. RSA ClearTrust™ is the Flagship product from RSA security in order to transparently implement authentication and authorization for large enterprises (using Linux / Solaris/ UNIX or windows environments). This implementation currently services the Dutch working population (7.5 million users) and Dutch businesses (400.000+ users). In this business case, ClearTrust™ was rolled out on ISAPI level within Microsoft Internet Information Server. Worked closely with RSA consultants and the ISP Getronics PinkRoccade to make this implementation a success.  To achieve interoperability with the RSA ClearTrust Java SDK’s and the Microsoft .NET environment, injected Java byte code interpreters. Extended RSA ClearTrust’s ISAPI functionality through this interoperability bridge to support authentication and authorisation against the Microsoft .NET standardized identity framework.   To assure performance for this large population, this bridge was first unit tested and then load tested on actual server cluster in the data centre prior the rollout of said solution. After the expected load was successfully tested, executed a stress test to consult on maximum capacity. This solution is now the main Internet application Portal of UWV, hosting many applications which utilize this framework.  Furthermore, RSA ClearTrust’s™ functionality was extended to support user (de)provisioning by calculating user population deltas in .NET service processes. RSA ClearTrust™ was also extended to support seamless authentication and authorisation of users for UWV signing on with a DigiD account. More functional extensions include delegated user-rights management. ",http://www.uwv.nl,2004,2007
Nationwide administration application for UWV,"For the government social department, sick leave administration, phased out original suite consisting of 6 intranet-only subsystems to eventually merge into one Internet application. Functioned in the capacity of a lead developer and lead various team members from diverse IT outsourcing companies.  The application was developed according to the new UWV reference architecture and integrated with the Portal system previously mentioned. As a result, sick leave administration has become a paperless procedure for 400.000+ employers and is an integral part to national employee benefits administration.",http://www.uwv.nl,2004,2007

Self Service Portal Wigo4it,"Self Service portal is built around a model driven architecture (MDA) provides a rendering strategy for producing HTML / CSS based fully responsive web sites using meta data definitions currently, but not limited to JSON. The portal is developed around SOLID principles and is completely plugable, for example in its Repostory and UI rendering strategy patterns. The current repository implementation binds to Microsoft CRM entities and provides data entry pages that can interact with multiple CRM entities at the same time through a single transaction mechanism.",,Oct 2016,
Cowz n' Bullz,"This is my fullstack journey for this year with the challenge to build a comprehensive system consisting out of modern (web)technologies. The fictitious business model of Cowz `n Bullz challenges this system and what it needs to comprise of. Though my intention is not to build a full system that meets all the business needs of the fictitious business model, it should hit some interesting design challenges along the way.  I hope this journey can be helpful to others in the open source community, that it aspires others to become full-stack engineers or deepening their knowledge about full-stack development in general.",https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/showcase,Feb 2021,
https://github.com/sjefvanleeuwen/GherkinWorkshop,"This project is an example automates the testing of the EV Charging Portal using TypeScript, Cucumber, and Playwright. The tests are written in a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style to simulate a user's interaction with the portal, including requesting a charge card, verifying agreements, using the charge card for charging, and ending contracts.  This portal is a intro demo to what you can achieve with this setup. It is part of a aprox. 2 hour Gherkin Workshop.",,,
