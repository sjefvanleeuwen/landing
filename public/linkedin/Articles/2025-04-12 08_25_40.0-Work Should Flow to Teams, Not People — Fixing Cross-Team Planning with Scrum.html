  <div><p>In complex product environments, cross-team collaboration is unavoidable. But there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it.</p><p>The wrong way? When Product Owners start pulling on <em>individuals</em> across teams—treating developers as floating resources to align timelines, rather than focusing on flowing <em>work</em> through empowered <em>teams</em>. The cost is high: stress, confusion, and a slow erosion of engineering culture.</p><p>Let’s be clear: <strong>work should flow to teams, not people.</strong> When we forget that, we break the very system we rely on to build software well.</p><hr><h3>The Anti-Pattern: People-Based Planning</h3><p>Here’s what it often looks like:</p><ul><li><p>POs identify a dependency or shared need.</p></li><li><p>Instead of aligning backlogs and delivery goals, they start “resource aligning.”</p></li><li><p>Specific developers are invited into meetings to scope and negotiate availability.</p></li><li><p>Work is handed to individuals, not planned through the team.</p></li></ul><p>It may feel efficient, but it creates a shadow process outside of Scrum—and developers get caught in the middle.</p><hr><h3>The Consequences: Burnout Over Velocity</h3><p>When planning happens <em>around</em> teams instead of <em>through</em> them:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Developers lose focus</strong> as they juggle competing priorities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stress increases</strong>—they’re stuck managing stakeholder expectations instead of doing the work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Team cohesion erodes</strong>—developers become “borrowed resources,” not part of a mission-driven unit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scrum loses power</strong>—the roles and rituals meant to support delivery are sidestepped.</p></li></ul><p>It’s a slow cultural leak, but it adds up.</p><hr><h3>The Better Way: Let Scrum Do Its Job</h3><p>Scrum is designed to <em>scale with complexity</em>, but only if we follow its core principles. Here’s how to realign:</p><hr><h3>✅ Flow Work to Teams, Not Individuals</h3><p>Work should be discussed, estimated, committed to, and delivered by <em>teams</em>. If you need cross-team effort, treat it as a coordination problem—not a resourcing one. Avoid cherry-picking people. Let teams self-organize around the work.</p><hr><h3>✅ Backlogs Drive the Conversation</h3><p>All work lives in a backlog. Period. That’s the PO’s domain. Dependencies should show up there—not in private DMs or planning backchannels. Sync backlogs early and often across teams.</p><hr><h3>✅ Scrum Masters Keep the System Healthy</h3><p>The Scrum Master ensures that planning remains team-based and sustainable. When cross-team work emerges, they help facilitate alignment—without sacrificing focus or sprint integrity.</p><hr><h3>✅ Use Scrum-of-Scrums for Cross-Team Alignment</h3><p>Create a regular forum where teams and their POs align priorities and surface dependencies. Focus on shared goals and delivery windows, not individual assignments.</p><hr><h3>What You Gain: Trust, Focus, and Delivery</h3><p>When work flows to teams:</p><ul><li><p>Developers feel trusted, not traded.</p></li><li><p>Teams maintain ownership over how and when they deliver.</p></li><li><p>Scrum works as intended—empowering autonomy and clarity.</p></li><li><p>You build a culture where engineers can do deep work, not just dodge calendar invites.</p></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Let’s stop managing people like puzzle pieces and start planning through teams.</strong> Scrum gives us the structure. Culture makes it stick.</p><hr><p>💬 <strong>Your thoughts?</strong> How do you manage cross-team dependencies without creating chaos for your developers?</p><p>#Agile #Scrum #EngineeringCulture #TeamAutonomy #CrossTeamPlanning #Leadership #DeveloperExperience #WorkShouldFlowToTeams</p></div>
