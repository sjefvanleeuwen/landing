  <div><p>In the agile world, the role of the Product Owner (PO) is crucial for guiding a team towards delivering valuable products. However, there has been a growing trend advocating for "Technical Product Owners" (TPOs)—individuals who combine product management skills with technical expertise. While this might sound like a silver bullet, let's examine why the notion of a Technical Product Owner might be more myth than magic, and why a Lead Developer or Lead Engineer could be a better solution. It’s time to slay the dragon of the Technical Product Owner myth.</p><h3>The Fundamental Role of a Product Owner</h3><p>At its core, the Product Owner's primary responsibility is to maximize the value of the product resulting from the work of the development team. This involves understanding customer needs, defining product vision, and prioritizing the product backlog to ensure the team delivers features that provide the most value. The PO is the linchpin between the stakeholders and the development team, ensuring that the final product aligns with the market and user demands.</p><h3>The Risk of Role Confusion</h3><p>Introducing a technical aspect to the Product Owner role blurs the lines between what the PO and the development team should be focusing on. A Technical Product Owner might find themselves getting too involved in how the product is built rather than what should be built. This shift can lead to several issues:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Diluted Focus</strong>: The PO’s attention is divided between technical concerns and product value, potentially neglecting crucial market insights and user feedback.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overstepping Boundaries</strong>: The development team, which is supposed to be self-organizing and autonomous, may find itself overridden by a TPO who delves too deeply into technical decision-making.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decision-Making Bottlenecks</strong>: Instead of streamlining processes, a TPO might slow down decision-making by introducing unnecessary technical scrutiny into discussions that should be driven by business value and customer needs.</p></li></ol><h3>The Perils of Technical Bias</h3><blockquote><p>The TPO might prioritize technical upgrades and refactoring that do not necessarily align with the customer’s pressing needs, thus misallocating resources</p></blockquote><p>A PO with a technical background may have a bias towards technical solutions, potentially overshadowing the real business value. This technical bias can manifest in several ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Over-Engineering</strong>: There might be a tendency to favor technically elegant solutions over more pragmatic, user-centric ones. This could lead to over-engineering, where the product becomes overly complex without delivering proportional business value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technical Debt Neglect</strong>: Conversely, a TPO might downplay the importance of managing technical debt, focusing more on immediate feature delivery rather than long-term product health.</p></li><li><p><strong>Misaligned Priorities</strong>: The TPO might prioritize technical upgrades and refactoring that do not necessarily align with the customer’s pressing needs, thus misallocating resources.</p></li></ol><h3>The Core Competency Conundrum</h3><blockquote><p>The core competency of a PO lies in their ability to deliver value through a deep understanding of the user and the market, not the underlying technology</p></blockquote><p>The skills required to be an effective Product Owner are distinct from those needed to excel in technical roles. A great Product Owner needs:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Market Understanding</strong>: Deep knowledge of the market, competition, and customer pain points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Visionary Thinking</strong>: The ability to articulate a clear product vision and roadmap.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder Management</strong>: Skills in negotiating and communicating with various stakeholders, including customers, management, and the development team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prioritization Prowess</strong>: The knack for prioritizing features based on business value, not technical complexity.</p></li></ol><p>While technical knowledge can be beneficial, it is not essential. The core competency of a PO lies in their ability to deliver value through a deep understanding of the user and the market, not the underlying technology.</p><h3>Lead Developers or Lead Engineers: A Better Solution</h3><p>Instead of trying to merge the roles of Product Owner and technical expert, it is more effective to introduce Lead Developers or Lead Engineers who can work closely with the Product Owner. Here’s why this approach is superior:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Clear Role Distinction</strong>: Lead Developers or Lead Engineers focus on the technical implementation, allowing the Product Owner to maintain a clear focus on product value. This separation prevents the dilution of responsibilities and ensures that each role can excel in its domain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Technical Guidance</strong>: Lead Developers or Lead Engineers bring deep technical expertise to the table, guiding the development team in best practices, architectural decisions, and technical problem-solving without overshadowing the Product Owner’s vision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Balanced Decision-Making</strong>: With Lead Developers or Lead Engineers, the team can better balance technical feasibility with business value. The Product Owner prioritizes the backlog based on customer needs, while the Lead Developer ensures that technical decisions support these priorities effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved Communication</strong>: This approach fosters better communication and collaboration. The Product Owner and Lead Developer can engage in meaningful dialogues about technical constraints and possibilities, ensuring that both business and technical perspectives are considered.</p></li></ol><h3>The Further Bias of the Technical Product Owner: Platform Teams and Misalignment</h3><blockquote><p>A TPO overseeing a platform team might prioritize technical aspects of the platform, such as infrastructure upgrades or new architectural patterns, over the immediate needs of the feature teams that rely on the platform to deliver customer value.</p></blockquote><p>When a Technical Product Owner is responsible for a platform team—a team whose work is foundational and upon which multiple feature teams depend—the risks and biases become even more pronounced. Here’s why:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Platform Focus Over Product Needs</strong>: A TPO overseeing a platform team might prioritize technical aspects of the platform, such as infrastructure upgrades or new architectural patterns, over the immediate needs of the feature teams that rely on the platform to deliver customer value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Misalignment with Feature Teams</strong>: Technical decisions made at the platform level may not align with the priorities or technical strategies of feature teams. This misalignment can lead to inefficiencies, where feature teams are unable to leverage the platform effectively or need to implement workarounds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inconsistent Technical Concerns</strong>: Different Product Owners not operating on the same technical level can lead to inconsistencies in addressing technical concerns. While the TPO may focus on platform scalability and performance, feature team POs might prioritize quick iterations and feature delivery, leading to conflicting technical requirements and priorities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Organizational Silos</strong>: The presence of a TPO can inadvertently create silos, where platform teams and feature teams are not communicating effectively. This lack of coordination can result in feature teams being unable to address their technical concerns at the same organizational level, leading to delays and suboptimal solutions.</p></li></ol><h3>Slaying the Dragon: Collaboration Over Consolidation</h3><blockquote><p>The PO articulates the "what" and "why," while the team figures out the "how."</p></blockquote><p>Instead of consolidating roles, a more effective approach is fostering collaboration between the Product Owner and the technical team, led by a Lead Developer or Lead Engineer. Here’s why:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Leverage Expertise</strong>: The development team should be trusted to handle technical decisions. They are experts in their field and should be empowered to design and implement solutions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on Value</strong>: The PO should focus on understanding and delivering customer value, relying on the technical team for feasibility and implementation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Communication</strong>: Clear separation of roles encourages better communication and collaboration. The PO articulates the "what" and "why," while the team figures out the "how."</p></li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The idea of a Technical Product Owner might seem appealing, but it fundamentally misunderstands the core responsibilities and skills required for effective product ownership. Rather than merging roles, it is more productive to maintain clear boundaries and foster strong collaboration between the PO and the development team, led by a Lead Developer or Lead Engineer. This ensures that the focus remains on delivering maximum value to the customer, leveraging the strengths of each role without unnecessary overlap. By doing so, organizations can achieve a harmonious balance between technical excellence and product value, leading to more successful product outcomes and avoiding the pitfalls of misalignment and inefficiency in platform and feature team coordination. It's time to slay the dragon of the Technical Product Owner myth and embrace a more effective and collaborative approach to agile product development.</p></div>
