  <p class="published">Published on ---</p>
  <div><p>10-Year NVIDIA Stock Projection Based on AI Energy Demand and Chip Production</p><p>The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) – from large language models to computer vision and beyond – is set to <strong>dramatically increase energy consumption and hardware demand</strong> over the next decade. This report compiles current research and forecasts on how AI workloads will strain power grids, drive massive investments in power generation (including nuclear energy), and ramp up semiconductor production. It also examines <strong>compound annual growth rates (CAGR)</strong> for AI-related energy use and hardware markets, and evaluates what this means for leading AI chipmakers like NVIDIA in the coming ten years.</p><h3>Surging Energy Consumption from AI Workloads</h3><p><strong>Global data center energy usage is projected to skyrocket</strong> due to AI. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), worldwide electricity demand from data centers will <strong>more than double from ~415 TWh in 2024 to ~945 TWh by </strong><a href="http://2030datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank"><strong>2030</strong>datacenterdynamics.com</a>. This 2024–2030 increase of ~530 TWh (+128%) equates to roughly a <strong>14–15% CAGR</strong> in data center power usage globally. The United States leads this surge – U.S. data centers are expected to increase consumption by ~240 TWh (a <strong>+130% jump</strong> vs 2024) by <a href="http://2030datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">2030datacenterdynamics.com</a>. (For comparison, China’s data centers may grow +175 TWh, +170%, over the same period, while Europe’s rise is ~45 TWh, +70%<a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>.)</p><p><strong>AI workloads are the chief driver</strong> of this energy explosion. Today, AI’s power draw already accounts for an estimated <strong>15–20% of global data center </strong><a href="http://electricitywired.comgoldmansachs.com" target="_blank"><strong>electricity</strong>wired.comgoldmansachs.com</a>. Researchers warn this share is climbing fast – one analysis finds <strong>AI’s energy use could double within a year</strong>, approaching <em>half</em> of all data center consumption by the end of <a href="http://2025wired.com" target="_blank">2025wired.com</a>. In the longer term, the IEA projects <strong>electricity demand from AI-optimized data centers will more than quadruple by </strong><a href="http://2030iea.org" target="_blank"><strong>2030</strong>iea.org</a>. In other words, as total data center power use roughly doubles, <strong>the AI portion might grow ~4×</strong>, likely boosting AI’s share of data center energy to on the order of ~40% (up from ~10–15% in the early 2020s). This aligns with Goldman Sachs forecasts that see AI pushing data center power requirements from ~55 GW in 2023 (14% AI-driven) to ~84 GW by 2027 (27% AI-driven), and as high as ~146 GW around 2030 (a <strong>~165% increase</strong> vs 2023)<a href="http://goldmansachs.comgoldmansachs.com" target="_blank">goldmansachs.comgoldmansachs.com</a>.</p><p><em>Key indicators of this trend include:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Generative AI training &amp; inference intensity:</strong> The training of frontier AI models (and the millions of daily inference queries they serve) consumes vast electricity. Tech giants report that AI is <strong>driving steep rises in energy use</strong> – for instance, Google’s operational emissions jumped ~48% from 2019 to 2022 largely due to expanded AI <a href="http://computingwired.com" target="_blank">computingwired.com</a>. Each new generation of large language model requires <em>orders of magnitude</em> more compute, translating to higher power draw for the data centers running them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exponentially growing compute demand:</strong> McKinsey estimates that <strong>global demand for data center capacity could nearly triple by 2030</strong>, with ~70% of that demand coming from AI <a href="http://workloadsmckinsey.com" target="_blank">workloadsmckinsey.com</a>. This suggests a very high growth rate (on the order of 15–20% annually) in computing power needs, overwhelming what incremental efficiency gains may be achieved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rising AI share relative to traditional IT:</strong> Traditional enterprise IT tasks (web hosting, email, etc.) are far less compute- and power-intensive than AI. As AI adoption expands, a larger fraction of data center racks are filled with power-hungry AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs). By one estimate, <strong>AI workloads will account for over 70% of data center power demand growth through </strong><a href="http://2030mckinsey.com" target="_blank"><strong>2030</strong>mckinsey.com</a>. In other words, nearly all new power consumption in data centers is coming from AI.</p></li></ul><p>These trends point to an <strong>unprecedented growth trajectory</strong> in energy consumption tied to AI. <strong>Global AI energy demand (directly attributable to AI computation) is on track to grow at ~30% CAGR or higher in the near term</strong>, far outpacing most other sectors. Even under more conservative scenarios (e.g. if efficiency improvements in AI models reduce compute needs per task), analysts still predict double-digit annual growth in power usage. The sheer scale of this demand is motivating equally large responses in the energy sector, as detailed next.</p><h3>Scaling Power Infrastructure: Renewables, Gas, and Nuclear</h3><p>Meeting AI’s ravenous appetite for electricity will require <strong>massive investments in power generation and grid infrastructure</strong>. Data centers already consume an estimated 1.5–2% of global electricity, and could reach ~<strong>3%+ by 2030</strong> on the above <a href="http://trajectoryiea.orgiea.org" target="_blank">trajectoryiea.orgiea.org</a>. Both industry and governments are responding with plans for new energy projects – from huge renewable deployments to dedicated natural gas plants and next-generation nuclear reactors – to ensure <strong>sufficient, reliable power for “AI factories.”</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Renewables ramp-up:</strong> A large share of the new electricity for data centers is expected to come from wind and solar. The IEA projects that <strong>renewable generation will grow by ~450 TWh by 2035 just to meet data center </strong><a href="http://demanddatacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank"><strong>demand</strong>datacenterdynamics.com</a>. By 2030, renewables (primarily wind, solar, hydro) could supply ~50% of data center electricity, up from ~27% in <a href="http://2024datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">2024datacenterdynamics.com</a>. Hyperscale cloud providers (like Google, Microsoft) have been signing massive power purchase agreements for solar and wind farms to power their AI data centers with green energy. However, scaling intermittent renewables also requires energy storage and grid upgrades to deliver consistent power for 24/7 AI workloads.</p></li><li><p><strong>New gas-fired power plants:</strong> In the near term, natural gas is playing a critical role in backing up renewables and providing on-demand power for data centers. In the U.S., utilities are <strong>building new gas capacity specifically to serve data center hubs</strong>. For example, Dominion Energy has sought approval to construct a new <strong>1,000 MW (1 GW) gas power plant in Virginia</strong> to supply the booming concentration of AI-ready data centers <a href="http://theredatacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">theredatacenterdynamics.com</a>. This $1+ billion “Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center” is slated to begin operation by 2029, directly addressing Northern Virginia’s surging data center <a href="http://loaddatacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">loaddatacenterdynamics.com</a>. Across the U.S., pro-gas policies and rising data demand have led to multiple <strong>“behind-the-meter” gas generation projects</strong> dedicated to large server <a href="http://farmsdatacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">farmsdatacenterdynamics.com</a>. Natural gas is expected to remain ~25%+ of the data center power mix through 2030, even as cleaner sources <a href="http://growdatacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">growdatacenterdynamics.com</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nuclear energy resurgence:</strong> Perhaps most striking is the renewed interest in nuclear power – especially <strong>small modular reactors (SMRs)</strong> and even fusion – to provide <strong>carbon-free, always-on electricity</strong> for AI infrastructure. Nuclear currently supplies about 15% of data center electricity <a href="http://globallynucnet.org" target="_blank">globallynucnet.org</a>. By 2030 that share could inch up to ~16–18%<a href="http://nucnet.org" target="_blank">nucnet.org</a>, and <strong>further expansions are expected post-2030 via SMR deployments in the U.S. and </strong><a href="http://Chinanucnet.orgnucnet.org" target="_blank"><strong>China</strong>nucnet.orgnucnet.org</a>. Several headline-grabbing deals illustrate this trend:</p></li></ul><p>These power initiatives represent just the beginning. <strong>Energy analysts note that even aggressive nuclear expansion will only partly fill the gap</strong> – Deloitte estimates that adding <strong>35–62 GW of new nuclear capacity by 2035</strong> could supply roughly <em>10% of the projected increase</em> in data center <a href="http://demandwww2.deloitte.comwww2.deloitte.com" target="_blank">demandwww2.deloitte.comwww2.deloitte.com</a>. In practice, a diversified approach is underway: <strong>major hyperscalers are investing in a mix of renewables + storage, efficiency measures, gas backup, and nascent nuclear options</strong> to guarantee the tens of billions of kilowatt-hours that AI will require. The scale is unprecedented: <strong>data centers are becoming a top-tier electricity consumer, comparable to medium-sized countries</strong>. By 2030, the ~945 TWh/yr consumed by data centers will exceed the entire current power usage of <a href="http://Japaniea.org" target="_blank">Japaniea.org</a>. This is spurring a “race” in the utility sector to build <strong>new power plants, grid connections, and clean energy sources</strong> fast enough to keep up with AI-driven demand.</p><p><em>Table: Projected Data Center Electricity Growth by 2030 (Key Regions)</em></p><p>RegionIncrease 2024→2030% Growth (2024→2030)<strong>Global+530 TWh</strong> (415 → 945 TWh)<a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a><strong>+128%</strong><a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a> (&gt;2× increase)United States+240 TWh (approx. 185 → 425 TWh)<a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>+130%<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/iea-data-center-energy-consumption-set-to-double-by-2030-to-945twh/#:~:text=In%20the%20US%2C%20consumption%20is,more%20than%2080%20percent%20jump" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>China+175 TWh (approx. 103 → 278 TWh)<a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>+170%<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/iea-data-center-energy-consumption-set-to-double-by-2030-to-945twh/#:~:text=In%20the%20US%2C%20consumption%20is,more%20than%2080%20percent%20jump" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>Europe+45 TWh (approx. 64 → 109 TWh)<a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>+70%<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/iea-data-center-energy-consumption-set-to-double-by-2030-to-945twh/#:~:text=In%20the%20US%2C%20consumption%20is,more%20than%2080%20percent%20jump" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>Japan+15 TWh (approx. 19 → 34 TWh)<a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a>+80%<a href="http://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">datacenterdynamics.com</a></p><p><em>Sources:</em> International Energy Agency Special Report on Energy and AI (2025) and <a href="http://DataCenterDynamicsdatacenterdynamics.comdatacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">DataCenterDynamicsdatacenterdynamics.comdatacenterdynamics.com</a>.</p><p>As shown above, the U.S. and China alone are expected to account for ~80% of the global data center power increase by <a href="http://2030datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">2030datacenterdynamics.com</a>. This concentration further explains why <strong>U.S. policy makers are exploring large-scale energy investments</strong> (including proposals for advanced nuclear and accelerated grid buildouts) to support AI growth. In fact, U.S. federal initiatives are in motion to fund AI infrastructure – for example, one recent plan (nicknamed the “Stargate Project”) aims to mobilize <strong>$500&nbsp;billion by 2028</strong> for AI and data center development in the <a href="http://U.S.cib.bnpparibas" target="_blank">U.S.cib.bnpparibas</a>. Power capacity will be a major chunk of such spending. Overall, <strong>ensuring adequate electricity is now seen as a strategic priority for AI leadership</strong>, on par with talent and algorithms.</p><h3>Explosive Growth in AI Hardware and Semiconductor Demand</h3><p>The surge in AI computing is mirrored by an enormous <strong>expansion in hardware demand</strong> – from cutting-edge chips (GPUs, AI accelerators) to the servers and data center infrastructure housing them. Analysts agree that <strong>the 2020s AI boom will drive one of the largest technology investment cycles in history</strong>, often compared to the build-out of the Internet itself. By the numbers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Data center hardware investment:</strong> McKinsey projects that <strong>nearly $7 trillion in capital outlays will be needed globally by 2030</strong> to scale data centers for <a href="http://AImckinsey.com" target="_blank">AImckinsey.com</a>. Of this, roughly <strong>$5.2 trillion is specifically for AI-focused infrastructure</strong> (high-density computing facilities), versus $1.5T for traditional IT data <a href="http://centersmckinsey.com" target="_blank">centersmckinsey.com</a>. In other words, <strong>AI alone demands over 75% of data center capex this decade</strong>. This staggering figure includes everything from construction and power equipment to, importantly, the <strong>semiconductors and systems</strong>. In fact, about 60% (≈$3.1 trillion) of the AI data center investment will go toward <strong>technology hardware – primarily chips and computing </strong><a href="http://equipmentmckinsey.com" target="_blank"><strong>equipment</strong>mckinsey.com</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI semiconductor market size:</strong> The market for AI chips is expanding at a breakneck pace. Estimates vary, but many researchers forecast on the order of <strong>30–35% CAGR in AI semiconductor revenues through 2030</strong>. For example, one analysis puts the <strong>AI-specific chip market at $53&nbsp;billion in 2024, growing to $296&nbsp;billion by 2030 (33% CAGR)</strong><a href="http://nextmsc.com" target="_blank"><strong>nextmsc.com</strong></a>. Others see even larger totals when including memory: industry projections suggest <strong>AI could drive global semiconductor sales past $1&nbsp;trillion by 2030</strong>, up from ~$600B in <a href="http://2022pwc.com" target="_blank">2022pwc.com</a>. Notably, by 2030 <strong>AI-related semiconductors may comprise over half of all semiconductor </strong><a href="http://revenuesemiengineering.com" target="_blank"><strong>revenue</strong>semiengineering.com</a>. In effect, <strong>AI is becoming the central growth engine for the entire chip industry</strong>, fueling demand for advanced logic chips (GPUs/ASICs), high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and specialized networking silicon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chip production volumes and new fabs:</strong> To meet this demand, chipmakers will have to substantially expand manufacturing capacity, especially at the leading-edge process nodes used for AI accelerators. A McKinsey study found that <strong>generative AI will likely require an additional 1.2 to 3.6 million top-end logic wafers annually by 2030</strong> (on ≤3 nm nodes) beyond baseline <a href="http://needsmckinsey.commckinsey.com" target="_blank">needsmckinsey.commckinsey.com</a>. This translates into a potential <strong>supply gap of ~1–4 million wafers</strong> that current fab expansion plans do not <a href="http://covermckinsey.com" target="_blank">covermckinsey.com</a>. In practical terms, the industry might need to build <strong>on the order of 3 to 9 new state-of-the-art fabs by 2030</strong> just to produce the AI processors in <a href="http://demandmckinsey.com" target="_blank">demandmckinsey.com</a>. High-performance memory is similarly challenged – AI servers’ voracious appetite for HBM and DDR RAM could require <strong>4–12 new memory fabs by 2030</strong> under aggressive AI adoption <a href="http://scenariosmckinsey.com" target="_blank">scenariosmckinsey.com</a>. This is a dramatic ramp-up in manufacturing: TSMC, Samsung, Intel and others are already investing hundreds of billions in new fabrication plants, many of which are being justified largely by <strong>AI chip orders</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hardware volume and shipment forecasts:</strong> The exact number of AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs/etc.) needed by 2030 is hard to pin down, but all signs point to a <strong>multi-fold increase in unit shipments</strong>. One industry forecast suggests that by 2030, <strong>annual data center GPU spending could reach $200–$270&nbsp;billion</strong> (versus tens of billions today), with the majority of those GPUs expected to be provided by <a href="http://NVIDIAsemiengineering.com" target="_blank">NVIDIAsemiengineering.com</a>. For perspective, a single cutting-edge AI supercomputer (like those used to train frontier models) might require <strong>tens of thousands of GPUs</strong>. In fact, researchers at Epoch AI estimate that by 2030, the largest AI training clusters could demand <strong>on the order of 2 million AI chips for one system</strong>, potentially costing $100–$200&nbsp;billion to <a href="http://buildbusinessinsider.com" target="_blank">buildbusinessinsider.com</a>. While that is an extreme scenario, it underscores the scale: <em>millions of advanced chips</em> will be deployed across data centers in the coming years. The <strong>compound growth rate in shipments of AI accelerators is likely 25–35% per year</strong> through most of the 2020s, far outpacing overall semiconductor unit growth. This includes GPUs, application-specific AI ASICs, and embedded AI chips for devices.</p></li></ul><p>All of the above points to <strong>robust double- or triple-digit growth across AI hardware metrics</strong>. To summarize a few <strong>notable CAGR figures</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI data center capacity:</strong> ~33% CAGR (2023–2030 midrange forecast) for “AI-ready” data center <a href="http://capacitymckinsey.com" target="_blank">capacitymckinsey.com</a>, per McKinsey. In other words, compute capacity devoted to AI could <strong>double roughly every 2.5 years</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI chip revenue:</strong> ~30%+ CAGR through 2030, with the AI chip market doubling in size roughly every ~2.5–3 <a href="http://yearsnextmsc.com" target="_blank">yearsnextmsc.com</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>High-bandwidth memory (HBM):</strong> ~58% CAGR in revenue (and 64% CAGR in bits) through 2028, reflecting exploding demand for AI-oriented memory <a href="http://chipspwc.com" target="_blank">chipspwc.com</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data center power demand (global):</strong> ~15% CAGR (2023–2030) in the baseline case, or up to ~20% under faster AI <a href="http://adoptiongoldmansachs.com" target="_blank">adoptiongoldmansachs.com</a>. Within that, <strong>power for AI workloads</strong> is growing even faster (~25–30% CAGR), as discussed earlier.</p></li></ul><p>These growth rates are historically exceptional – for instance, the global semiconductor industry grew ~5–8% annually over past decades, but is now aiming for ~12% CAGR to hit $1T by <a href="http://2030pwc.com" target="_blank">2030pwc.com</a>, largely thanks to AI. <strong>Such rapid expansion is not without challenges</strong>: supply chain constraints, steep capital requirements, and technical hurdles (e.g. power efficiency limits, cooling for dense AI racks, etc.) will need to be overcome. Nonetheless, the overall outlook is one of <em>high-volume scaling</em>: the industry is gearing up to ship <strong>hundreds of millions of AI chips, build dozens of new data centers and fabs, and upgrade power infrastructure worldwide</strong> – all in the span of a decade.</p><h3>Implications for NVIDIA: A 10-Year Trajectory</h3><p>No company is more central to these trends than <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, the dominant supplier of GPUs for AI. The confluence of exploding AI compute demand and tight hardware supply has already turned NVIDIA into one of the world’s most valuable companies – and the next ten years could extend that trajectory. <strong>NVIDIA’s business has been surging in lockstep with the AI boom</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><em>Soaring revenue:</em> NVIDIA’s data center segment (which is largely AI accelerators) has experienced unprecedented growth. In the first calendar quarter of 2024, NVIDIA reported data center revenue of <strong>$22.6&nbsp;billion for the quarter, up a stunning 427% </strong><a href="http://year-on-yearnvidianews.nvidia.com" target="_blank"><strong>year-on-year</strong>nvidianews.nvidia.com</a>. This figure (achieved in just one quarter) exceeded the company’s <em>entire annual</em> revenue of the previous year. By early 2025, data center and AI-related products accounted for ~87% of NVIDIA’s <a href="http://revenuesstatista.com" target="_blank">revenuesstatista.com</a>. This meteoric rise reflects essentially insatiable demand from cloud providers and enterprises racing to deploy AI. NVIDIA has repeatedly beaten earnings expectations, and its stock price climbed ~<strong>150%+ in 2023 alone</strong> on the strength of AI <a href="http://ordersnasdaq.com" target="_blank">ordersnasdaq.com</a>.</p></li><li><p><em>Market leadership:</em> NVIDIA currently enjoys an estimated <strong>80%+ share of the AI accelerator market</strong>, making it the primary beneficiary of growth in GPU spending. Analysts foresee that <strong>GPU spending could reach $200–270&nbsp;billion by 2030, “mostly from Nvidia”</strong> given its market <a href="http://dominancesemiengineering.com" target="_blank">dominancesemiengineering.com</a>. NVIDIA’s closest rival, AMD, is attempting to compete for a greater share of this pie, but NVIDIA’s ecosystem advantages (CUDA software platform, networking tech like NVLink, and a one–two punch of GPU + AI-optimized CPU offerings) position it strongly to capture the bulk of AI hardware <a href="http://dollarssemiengineering.comsemiengineering.com" target="_blank">dollarssemiengineering.comsemiengineering.com</a>. Moreover, if AI semiconductor revenues indeed become over half of the $1T+ semi industry by <a href="http://2030semiengineering.com" target="_blank">2030semiengineering.com</a>, NVIDIA is poised to be one of the single largest chip companies in the world by revenue.</p></li><li><p><em>Scaling production:</em> To meet demand, NVIDIA has secured priority with manufacturers (like TSMC) for cutting-edge capacity. The company is effectively “pre-buying” huge amounts of 3nm silicon to produce its next-gen GPU (codenamed Blackwell), anticipating continued exponential growth in <a href="http://ordersnvidianews.nvidia.com" target="_blank">ordersnvidianews.nvidia.com</a>. Supply remains a near-term constraint – large customers sometimes wait months for H100 GPUs – but NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang noted they are “in full production” on new products and even launching turnkey AI data center solutions to accelerate <a href="http://deploymentnvidianews.nvidia.com" target="_blank">deploymentnvidianews.nvidia.com</a>. Over the next decade, NVIDIA may also diversify manufacturing (e.g. leveraging new fabs from Intel/Samsung if needed) as <strong>AI demand potentially outstrips the capacity of any single </strong><a href="http://foundrysemiengineering.com" target="_blank"><strong>foundry</strong>semiengineering.com</a>. The company’s challenge is to scale output fast enough to avoid bottlenecking AI growth.</p></li></ul><p>Given these dynamics, <strong>many investors are extremely bullish on NVIDIA’s 10-year outlook</strong>. One prominent tech analyst, Beth Kindig, recently projected that <em>NVIDIA could reach a $10&nbsp;trillion market capitalization by </em><a href="http://2030nasdaq.com" target="_blank"><em>2030</em>nasdaq.com</a>. That implies roughly a <strong>3× to 4× increase in value</strong> from mid-2024 levels (when NVIDIA was around $2–3T in market cap after a major run-up)<a href="http://nasdaq.comnasdaq.com" target="_blank">nasdaq.comnasdaq.com</a>. In stock terms, this optimistic scenario equates to a ~15–20% annual stock price appreciation through the decade, on top of the huge gains already seen. The rationale is that <strong>NVIDIA will continue to ride the AI adoption curve</strong>, translating the industry’s ~30% CAGR in AI hardware demand into strong double-digit growth in its own revenues and earnings. If NVIDIA maintains its technological edge, its pricing power (currently very high for AI GPUs) and volumes could drive unprecedented financial results by 2030. Indeed, NVIDIA’s CEO has called the emergence of AI <strong>“the next industrial revolution”</strong> and envisions building “<strong>AI factories</strong>” as ubiquitous as traditional data <a href="http://centersnvidianews.nvidia.com" target="_blank">centersnvidianews.nvidia.com</a> – a vision in which NVIDIA supplies not just chips but entire stacks of hardware and software.</p><p>Of course, there are <em>risks and variables</em> in any 10-year forecast. Potential factors that could affect NVIDIA’s trajectory include increased competition (AMD, Google TPUs, emerging AI chip startups), changes in AI compute paradigms (more efficient algorithms could moderate hardware needs), and geopolitical/export constraints in key markets. For example, if new AI models like DeepSeek (a more efficient Chinese LLM) prove that significantly less compute can achieve similar results, it might slightly <strong>taper the exponential hardware demand</strong> in later <a href="http://yearsgoldmansachs.com" target="_blank">yearsgoldmansachs.com</a>. Goldman Sachs analysts note that improved efficiency or slower AI adoption could soften data center power and capex needs in the late <a href="http://2020sgoldmansachs.comgoldmansachs.com" target="_blank">2020sgoldmansachs.comgoldmansachs.com</a> – which would in turn affect companies like NVIDIA. Nonetheless, the consensus baseline sees <strong>robust growth continuing</strong>. Even under conservative cases, NVIDIA is expected to substantially expand its revenues from the ~$60B level in 2024 to hundreds of billions annually by the early 2030s, commensurate with the broader AI market growth.</p><p>In summary, <strong>the next decade’s AI-driven indicators all point upward for NVIDIA</strong>: unprecedented energy consumption (necessitating more chips), huge CAGR figures for AI hardware spending, and entire new industries (like autonomous vehicles, generative AI services, robotics, etc.) that will further add to demand for NVIDIA’s products. If these trends manifest as projected, NVIDIA’s business could transform in scale – potentially joining the exclusive ranks of the world’s first $10&nbsp;trillion companies – while playing a central role in enabling the AI revolution.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><ul><li><p>International Energy Agency (2025), <em>Energy and AI</em> – data center electricity <a href="http://forecastsiea.orgdatacenterdynamics.comdatacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank">forecastsiea.orgdatacenterdynamics.comdatacenterdynamics.com</a></p></li><li><p>Wired (May 2025) – AI share of data center power and Big Tech energy <a href="http://usewired.comwired.com" target="_blank">usewired.comwired.com</a></p></li><li><p>Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (2023) – AI impact on data center power <a href="http://demandgoldmansachs.comgoldmansachs.com" target="_blank">demandgoldmansachs.comgoldmansachs.com</a></p></li><li><p>Deloitte Insights (Apr 2025) – Nuclear power for data centers, capacity <a href="http://projectionswww2.deloitte.comnucnet.org" target="_blank">projectionswww2.deloitte.comnucnet.org</a></p></li><li><p>The Guardian (Oct 2024) – Google, Microsoft, Amazon nuclear power deals for AI <a href="http://centerstheguardian.comtheguardian.com" target="_blank">centerstheguardian.comtheguardian.com</a></p></li><li><p>BNP Paribas (Markets 360, May 2025) – U.S. AI infrastructure investment (“Stargate”)<a href="http://cib.bnpparibas" target="_blank">cib.bnpparibas</a></p></li><li><p>McKinsey (2025) – <em>Cost of Compute</em> report, data center capex and AI capacity <a href="http://growthmckinsey.commckinsey.com" target="_blank">growthmckinsey.commckinsey.com</a></p></li><li><p>McKinsey (2024) – <em>Generative AI and Semiconductors</em> report, wafer demand and fab <a href="http://needsmckinsey.commckinsey.com" target="_blank">needsmckinsey.commckinsey.com</a></p></li><li><p>PwC / Omdia (Nov 2024) – Global semiconductor revenue outlook (&gt;$1T by 2030)<a href="http://pwc.com" target="_blank">pwc.com</a></p></li><li><p>SemiEngineering (Geoff Tate, 2025) – AI chips exceeding 50% of semi market by <a href="http://2030semiengineering.com" target="_blank">2030semiengineering.com</a>, GPU/ASIC spending <a href="http://splitsemiengineering.com" target="_blank">splitsemiengineering.com</a></p></li><li><p>NVIDIA financial releases – Q1 FY2025 record data center revenue, +427% <a href="http://YoYnvidianews.nvidia.com" target="_blank">YoYnvidianews.nvidia.com</a></p></li><li><p>Nasdaq/Motley Fool (July 2024) – Analyst prediction of NVIDIA $10T market cap by <a href="http://2030nasdaq.com" target="_blank">2030nasdaq.com</a>.</p></li></ul></div>
