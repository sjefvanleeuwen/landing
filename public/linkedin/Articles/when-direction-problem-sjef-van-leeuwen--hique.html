  <div><p><em>Reflections from multiple transformations in IT</em></p><p>Over the course of my career, I have been part of several major transformations in IT organizations. Different companies, different contexts, but strikingly similar patterns.</p><p>Three of those transformations stand out.</p><p>One involved a shift from a traditional hierarchical organization to a matrix model, where accountability moved closer to teams and decision-making became more distributed. </p><p>Another required moving away from a classical ITIL-driven setup, where Development, Operations, and Control were separate departments,t oward self-organizing DevOps teams with end-to-end ownership. </p><p>A third was driven by market pressure, where a digital product had to be reinvented simply to remain relevant.</p><p>Despite their differences, these transformations all taught me the same lesson:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Direction is rarely the hard part. Making the organization capable of carrying that direction is.”</strong></p></blockquote><hr><h3>Transformation is not a plan</h3><p>In each of these cases, strategy and direction were not the bottleneck. The destination was clear. What proved far more challenging was reshaping the system around it.</p><p>Plans, roadmaps, and target models were necessary, but never sufficient.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“A plan explains what should happen. Change shows up in what people actually do.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Real transformation only started once the organization stopped treating change as a project and began treating it as a shift in daily behavior.</p><hr><h3>From hierarchy to shared ownership</h3><p>In the transition from hierarchical to matrix organizations, the most significant change was not structural, it was cultural.</p><p>Authority gradually shifted away from fixed roles and titles toward contribution, expertise, and context. Teams were no longer merely execution units; they became owners of outcomes.</p><p>A critical enabler in this shift was the introduction of <strong>Business and IT Engineering chapters</strong>.</p><p>These chapters cut across team boundaries and created shared accountability for:</p><ul><li><p>engineering standards</p></li><li><p>business domain understanding</p></li><li><p>quality and reliability</p></li><li><p>ways of working</p></li></ul><p>They became places where people aligned on <em>how</em> work should be done, while teams remained focused on <em>what</em> they needed to deliver.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Chapters turned ownership from something individual into something collective.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Traditional line management lost its central role. Leadership shifted from directing work to enabling teams, developing capability, removing obstacles, and maintaining coherence across the system.</p><hr><h3>From ITIL and Development silos to DevOps teams</h3><p>One of the most impactful transformations I experienced was the move away from a classical ITIL-oriented model.</p><p>In that setup:</p><ul><li><p>Development built features</p></li><li><p>Operations kept systems running</p></li><li><p>Control functions guarded process and compliance</p></li></ul><p>Work flowed between departments through handovers, tickets, and escalation paths.</p><p>The transition to self-organizing DevOps teams fundamentally changed this dynamic.</p><p>Teams became responsible for the <strong>entire lifecycle</strong> of their products: build, run, improve. Operational stability, quality, and reliability were no longer “someone else’s problem”.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“You cannot build fast feedback loops when responsibility is fragmented across departments.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>This shift required everyone to wear multiple hats. Engineers, testers, product thinkers, and operations specialists collaborated as peers. Managers evolved from coordinators into leaders who understood the technology well enough to support meaningful decision-making.</p><p>Heavy ITIL processes, once designed to create safety, were gradually replaced by trust, transparency, and shared accountability.</p><hr><h3>Reinventing products under pressure</h3><p>The third transformation was driven by the market itself.</p><p>There was no time for prolonged alignment cycles. A digital product needed reinvention simply to stay relevant.</p><p>What made the difference was not urgency alone, but coherence: clear ownership, rapid feedback, and strong collaboration between business and engineering.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Resilience does not come from process. It comes from people who understand the full system.”</strong></p></blockquote><hr><h3>Influencing change through enablement</h3><p>In one organization, influence did not come from formal authority or hierarchical position, but from enablement.</p><p>A small team was set up to support innovation across the company, often referred to as a bimodal organization. Rather than owning delivery themselves, this team focused on increasing the organization’s capacity to innovate.</p><p>Their role was to enable others to:</p><ul><li><p>pitch ideas clearly and convincingly across the organization</p></li><li><p>translate early concepts into concrete proposals</p></li><li><p>initiate and facilitate design sprints to explore problems collaboratively</p></li><li><p>prototype quickly to validate assumptions and reduce uncertainty</p></li></ul><p>This approach lowered the threshold for experimentation and shortened learning cycles. People from different domains could find each other, collaborate across organizational boundaries, and move ideas forward without waiting for formal programs or structural changes.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Influence scaled when people were enabled to act, not when they were told what to do.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>From a leadership perspective, this was not about decentralizing chaos. It was about creating clear guardrails, shared language, and practical support so that initiative could emerge responsibly and at scale.</p><hr><h3>The overlooked capability: systems thinking</h3><p>Across all these transformations, one capability consistently separated progress from stagnation: systems thinking.</p><p>Change always has second-order effects. Optimizing locally, within one team, role, or function, almost always shifts pressure elsewhere.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Without systems thinking, organizations solve one problem and unknowingly create several new ones.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Business and IT Engineering chapters played an important role here as well, providing forums where these broader effects could be discussed beyond individual team boundaries.</p><hr><h3>Why discomfort is unavoidable</h3><p>None of these transformations were comfortable. Nor should they have been.</p><p>Roles changed. Certainties dissolved. Long-established processes were questioned.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“If no one feels uncomfortable, the system is probably not changing.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>The goal was not to remove discomfort, but to ensure it remained constructive rather than destructive.</p><hr><h3>In closing</h3><p>Looking back across these transformations, three themes consistently reinforced each other: systems thinking, shared ownership, and enablement.</p><p>Systems thinking made it possible to see beyond local optimizations and anticipate second-order effects. Shared ownership ensured that responsibility stayed close to the work. Enablement created the conditions for people to contribute, learn, and adapt without waiting for permission.</p><p>Together, these elements increased innovation throughput, accelerated learning, and strengthened organizational resilience, not by adding more structure, but by making the system itself more capable.</p><p>Direction matters, but it is only the starting point.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“Change begins when the organization itself starts to behave differently.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>That shift does not come from plans alone. It comes from leaders who understand the system, invest in capability, and are willing to stay present when change becomes uncomfortable.</p></div>
