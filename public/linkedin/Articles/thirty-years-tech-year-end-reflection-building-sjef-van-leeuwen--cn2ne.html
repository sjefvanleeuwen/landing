  <div><p>As the year winds down and the holidays begin to glow at the edges of everyday life, I catch myself reflecting more than usual. Partly because 2025 has been a year of intensity, transformation, and clarity, and partly because this year marks something I never expected to say out loud:</p><h3>My 30-year jubilee in tech.</h3><p>(Silver in wedding years. In career years? Maybe Pearl. Maybe Titanium. But whatever the material, it feels earned.)</p><p>Three decades is long enough to see hype cycles rise and die, architectures collapse and resurrect, methodologies evolve, platforms vanish, new leaders emerge, and entire industries reshape themselves. But it’s also long enough to understand something deeper:</p><h3>Technology changes fast. People change slowly. And culture, if we don’t nurture it, doesn’t change at all.</h3><p>Over the past year, through late-night writing sessions, architectural debates, leadership challenges, quiet breakthroughs, and moments of unexpected clarity, I found myself documenting the kind of thinking that has shaped me.</p><p>This post is a reflection on those articles, the lessons inside them, and the person behind them.</p><hr><h3>🌱 The year I learned to write honestly again</h3><p>When I look back at all the articles I wrote, and reading them now through fresh eyes, I recognize something I hadn’t noticed at the time:</p><p><strong>I wasn’t just analyzing technology. I was writing myself through a transition.</strong></p><p>A transition from:</p><ul><li><p>ambition to purpose</p></li><li><p>pressure to clarity</p></li><li><p>reacting to leading</p></li><li><p>surviving to contributing</p></li><li><p>and from silence to voice</p></li></ul><hr><h3>💡 Themes that kept returning in my writing</h3><h3>1. The Builder’s Mindset</h3><p><strong>Scaling-Up Requires Builders</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/scaling-up-requires-builders-passion-sjef-van-leeuwen--yowge/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/scaling-up-requires-builders-passion-sjef-van-leeuwen--yowge/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>“You can’t scale a company on decks, strategy sessions, or frameworks. Real scale comes from empowering the people who build.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>The piece explored how scaling is ultimately the result of hands-on creation. It reflected on the way progress emerges from writing code, improving infrastructure, shaping architectural direction, and putting real increments into the world. The article argued that durable growth comes from the people who build, refine, and iterate — and that every meaningful transformation starts with their work.</p><hr><h3>2. Psychological Safety &amp; Truth-Telling</h3><p><strong>Psychological Safety: The Foundation of High-Performing Teams</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/psychological-safety-foundation-high-performing-teams-van-leeuwen--bytke/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/psychological-safety-foundation-high-performing-teams-van-leeuwen--bytke/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>“A team that fears being honest will never be innovative, they will only be careful.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>This article explored honesty as a prerequisite for innovation. It highlighted how openness, clarity, and permission to speak freely create the conditions for experimentation and progress. It served as a reminder that high‑performing engineering cultures are built on trust, not fear, and that technical excellence cannot thrive without psychological safety.</p><hr><h3>3. Technology as Craft</h3><p><strong>Vibe Coding: Building a Complete Database Engine</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vibe-coding-building-complete-database-engine-from-van-leeuwen--hweie/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vibe-coding-building-complete-database-engine-from-van-leeuwen--hweie/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>“Innovation happens when we explore new technologies with curiosity, experiment boldly, and let AI amplify what we can create.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>This piece framed engineering as a craft that is rapidly accelerating. It explored how working close to the metal, building systems end‑to‑end, and understanding behaviour at a deeper level are becoming differentiators in a world where AI and automation raise the baseline. The article pointed to a future where engineers who master their craft, stay curious, and embrace technical depth can achieve far more than they currently imagine. It suggested that the years ahead hold an expanded horizon for those willing to experiment, learn continuously, and use technology as a vehicle for possibility rather than limitation.</p><hr><h3>4. Strategy, Vision, and the Need for a Direction</h3><p><strong>Why Every Modern Organization Needs a North Star</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-every-modern-organization-needs-north-star-before-van-leeuwen--pcxee/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-every-modern-organization-needs-north-star-before-van-leeuwen--pcxee/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>“Without a North Star, every motion looks like progress.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>This article examined how teams drift without a clear guiding direction. It reflected on the importance of aligning decisions, priorities, and engineering effort with a shared purpose. Without that compass, organisations risk mistaking movement for momentum, and activity for progress. The theme returned throughout the year: teams work best when they know where they are heading.</p><hr><h3>5. Building Culture, Not Process</h3><p><strong>Underpromise. Overdeliver.</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/underpromise-overdeliver-how-measure-agile-software-van-leeuwen--myoye/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/underpromise-overdeliver-how-measure-agile-software-van-leeuwen--myoye/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>“Process can’t save a team that has lost its culture.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>This article argued that sustainable delivery depends on clarity, realistic commitments, and shared expectations. It explored how predictability comes from steady rhythm, honest planning, and the space to negotiate trade‑offs. Rather than adding process, it suggested focusing on strengthening the culture that makes consistent delivery possible.</p><hr><h3>🔦 Threads Running Through This Year’s Writing</h3><p>Across the articles published this year, several themes emerged with consistency and depth, not as observations made from a distance, but as lived experiences expressed through craft, clarity, and engineering practice.</p><h3>The Builder’s Mindset in Practice</h3><p>In <em>Scaling-Up Requires Builders</em> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/scaling-up-requires-builders-passion-sjef-van-leeuwen--yowge/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/scaling-up-requires-builders-passion-sjef-van-leeuwen--yowge/</a>), the focus was on the essential role of hands‑on creation. The article expanded on how real progress in technology does not originate in governance decks or programs, but in small, concrete acts of building, writing code, shaping architecture, improving developer experience, and enabling teams to ship.</p><h3>Safety as the Core of Innovation</h3><p><em>Psychological Safety: The Foundation of High-Performing Teams</em> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/psychological-safety-foundation-high-performing-teams-van-leeuwen--bytke/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/psychological-safety-foundation-high-performing-teams-van-leeuwen--bytke/</a>) explored how honesty, clarity, and permission to speak form the bedrock of high-performing engineering cultures. The emphasis throughout the year remained consistent: without psychological safety, technical excellence cannot sustain itself.</p><h3>Craftsmanship and Technical Depth</h3><p>In <em>Vibe Coding: Building a Complete Database Engine</em> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vibe-coding-building-complete-database-engine-from-van-leeuwen--hweie/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vibe-coding-building-complete-database-engine-from-van-leeuwen--hweie/</a>), the writing leaned into the joy of creation, the energy of working close to the metal, understanding system behaviour, and building something end‑to‑end. Much of this year’s thinking returned to the theme of software as craft, not just industry.</p><h3>Direction, Purpose, and Strategic Alignment</h3><p><em>Why Every Modern Organization Needs a North Star</em> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-every-modern-organization-needs-north-star-before-van-leeuwen--pcxee/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-every-modern-organization-needs-north-star-before-van-leeuwen--pcxee/</a>) argued that without a clear guiding direction, motion can be mistaken for progress. This idea surfaced repeatedly: teams need a compass, not just tasks.</p><h3>Culture Over Process</h3><p>In <em>Underpromise. Overdeliver.</em> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/underpromise-overdeliver-how-measure-agile-software-van-leeuwen--myoye/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/underpromise-overdeliver-how-measure-agile-software-van-leeuwen--myoye/</a>), the focus was on keeping delivery grounded by making realistic commitments, tightening scope, and building predictability without over‑promising. It highlighted the value of steady rhythm, clear trade‑offs, and honest planning. Instead of chasing velocity, it pointed to confidence built release by release and the trust that grows when teams consistently deliver what they commit to.</p><h3>The Changing Shape of Engineering</h3><p><em>Rise of the AI SWE: How the Engineer Role Will Evolve</em> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-a-swe-how-software-engineer-role-evolve-sjef-van-leeuwen--l7nhe/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-a-swe-how-software-engineer-role-evolve-sjef-van-leeuwen--l7nhe/</a>) examined the shifting role of engineers in an AI‑augmented world, emphasising intention, responsibility, and the ability to work at higher levels of abstraction.</p><hr><h3>🛠️ “A difficult part of my story, one I don’t often share"</h3><p>This year’s writing unfolded against a backdrop I rarely put into words. Behind the work, the articles, the steady cadence of building and leading, there was a much heavier reality running in parallel.</p><p>I spent more than seven years walking alongside my partner through a long and difficult battle with cancer, a journey that reshaped everything: how I see time, how I understand resilience, and how I show up in my work and for the people around me. Losing her was the hardest moment of my life, and nothing in my professional world can be separated from that truth.</p><p>I didn’t write about it directly in any of the articles, but it lived between every sentence. It shaped the kind of clarity I reached for, the discipline I leaned on, and the way I approached leadership, stability, and consistency. It made the themes of honesty, delivery, purpose, and craftsmanship feel not just important, but essential.</p><p>And despite the weight of that journey, I kept going:</p><ul><li><p>writing</p></li><li><p>analysing</p></li><li><p>building</p></li><li><p>guiding</p></li><li><p>supporting</p></li><li><p>and staying committed to the work that still needed to be done</p></li></ul><p>The fact that the writing continued at all is part of the story, not as a claim of strength, but as a reflection of what it takes to keep moving when life becomes something you never expected to carry.</p><hr><h3>🎄 So what does a 30-year jubilee really mean?</h3><p>Maybe it isn’t about the years. Maybe it’s about the consistency.</p><p>Three decades of:</p><ul><li><p>caring about engineering</p></li><li><p>fighting for culture</p></li><li><p>coaching and mentoring </p></li><li><p>building systems that outlive their creators</p></li><li><p>holding onto standards even when others slip</p></li><li><p>and writing with a clarity that only comes from experience</p></li></ul><hr><h3>✨ A final thought, looking toward the engineering journey ahead</h3><p><strong>Rise of the AI SWE: How the Engineer Role Will Evolve</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-a-swe-how-software-engineer-role-evolve-sjef-van-leeuwen--l7nhe/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-a-swe-how-software-engineer-role-evolve-sjef-van-leeuwen--l7nhe/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>“The future belongs to engineers who can think, tell the truth, and build with intention.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>This quote points forward rather than inward. It highlights the direction engineering is moving as AI transforms how we design systems, make decisions, and build products. The coming years will demand clarity of thought, ethical judgment, and the ability to navigate higher‑order complexity while keeping craftsmanship alive. This evolution isn’t abstract, it’s already unfolding in how teams shape architecture, collaborate, and deliver. It sets the stage for the near‑future journey we are stepping into together, a shift defined not by tools but by how we choose to build and lead.</p><hr><h3>🎁 To everyone reading, thank you</h3><p>As this year draws to a close:</p><ul><li><p>I’m grateful for everyone who reads my work and for everyone who has been part of this journey.</p></li><li><p>I’m grateful for the conversations it starts</p></li><li><p>And I’m grateful for those who continue building with integrity</p></li></ul><p>Here’s to a new year. A new chapter. And the next decade of doing what matters.</p><h3>🎄 Wishing you all warm holidays, clarity, courage, and good company.</h3><p><strong>Sjef</strong></p></div>
