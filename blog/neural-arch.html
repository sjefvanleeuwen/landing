                    <p>
                        The interface between biological logic and synthetic hardware is no longer a theoretical boundary—it is a design challenge. By utilizing carbon-nanotube lattices, we can create environments that learn from their occupants. These structures are not static; they are living, breathing entities that respond to the cognitive load of everyone within their reach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recursive feedback loops are integrated into the very fiber of the building. Sensors embedded in the walls monitor neural oscillation, adjusting lighting, acoustics, and даже layout configuration to optimize for the task at hand. This is the marriage of architecture and neuroscience, a symphony of bits and atoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we move further into the age of the synaptically-linked city, the role of the architect shifts. We are no longer designing containers for life; we are designing the cognitive substrate upon which future societies will be built. The Neural Arch is the first step toward a sentient infrastructure.

                    <p>
                        As the network grows, the architecture adapts. Unlike traditional rigid structures, Neural Arch modules can be hot-swapped without disrupting the central processing core. This modularity allows for infinite expansion across urban environments. The city itself becomes a distributed neural network, processing information at the speed of light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the reverse-dual models, scalability is achieved through fractal repetition. Each module contains a miniature version of the whole, ensuring that even if significant portions of the network are offline, the local environment remains functional and optimized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This decentralized approach to architectural logic mirrors the resilience of the human prefrontal cortex. It is robust, adaptive, and infinitely scalable—a blueprint for the megacity of tomorrow.
